# 24/27-form-validation

This project is all about creating a form with proper validation and error messages.

I will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [vite bundler](https://vitejs.dev/) and for styling [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).
